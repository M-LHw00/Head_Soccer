# Head_Soccer
15112 project Head Soccer Champions League


This game is based off of an actual game "Head Soccer". In this game, the player will compete with the computer to reach until the finals round. Users will be able to play the game with real soccer players as the characters.


How to run the game
run main.py and then everything else is set up for you.


Libraries used
I'll be only using pygame in my game.
Which libraries you're using that need to be installed. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.


In the game, there are several shortcut commans that might be convenient to use.
1: player 1 wins the game  
2: player 2 wins the game
When scored: press spacebar and the score screen will be skipped
To pause: press esc
